Overview

This document will walk you through a basic installation and creation of a new X-Objects instance and application.


To install:

1) Copy /x_objects subdirectory (all contents) to your webroot

2) Create a new mysql database, and a user with dba-level privileges.  Make a note of the username and password for later.

3) Import the script /x_objects/sql/install.sql into your new database

Note: for now, this script merely creates the application event log table.

4) Run the installer at http://yoursite.yourdomain.com/x_objects/install/

5) Rename templates/htaccess.txt to /.htaccess OR append the required rules to your existing htaccess file

6) Attempt to load your new application's home page

DONE!
