Overview

This document will walk you through a basic installation and creation of a new X-Objects instance and application.

Installation
============

Follow these steps to install.  Send questions, problems, bugs, or feedback to <support@x-objects.org>

1) Download this entire repository onto the system where you will run one or more web applications.

We recommend installing into a directory that is accessible to web processes, but NOT in the webroot or its 
sub-directories.

For example, if your web server runs as:

/home/webuser/www/

Then consider installing into:

/home/webuser/x_objects/

2) Create a new mysql database, and a user with dba-level privileges.  Make a note of the username and password for later.

3) Import the script /x_objects/sql/core.sql into your new database

4) From the command-line you can create a new web application as follows:

$ cd /home/webuser/www/
$ php5 /home/webuser/x_objects/xobjects.php webapp myapp

This will build your webapp in /home/webuser/www/myapp

5) Edit your app's index file and make sure the paths are correct; they should have been set by the installer:

Edit /home/webuser/www/myapp/index.php and check the values of $xobjects_location and $webapp_location.  For this
example, the values would be:

$xobjects_location = "/home/webuser/x_objects/x_objects/";
$webapp_location = "/home/webuser/www/myapp";

6) Make sure you have updated any virtual host information so you can invoke your web app directly

DONE!
