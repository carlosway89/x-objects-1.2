            <h1>Welcome to X-Objects 1.2</h1>
            <h2>Overview</h2>
            <p>X-Objects allows you to build Applications and Websites for Desktop and Mobile use
            quickly and easily.  The Framework features an ample library of PHP Objects to quickly
            construct complex functionality as simple Web Components, as well as third party Components
            and Frameworks like Skeleton (http://getskeleton.com) and jQuery UI (http://ui.jquery.com)
            to facilitate rapid and elegant UI Development.
            </p>
            <h2>Getting Started</h2>
            <p>The following Guides will help you get started more quickly with X-Objects.  We have
                numbered them, as it might be more beneficial to follow in the order prescribed.
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li><a href="install.html">Installing X-Objects (creating your first App)</a></li>
                <li><a href="models.html">Working with Models and Business Objects</a></li>
                <li><p>Create a new mysql database, and a user with dba-level privileges.  Make a note of the username and password for later.</p></li>
                <li>Import the script /x_objects/sql/core.sql into your new database</li>
                <li>
                    <p>From the command-line you can create a new web application as follows:</p>
                    <pre>$ cd /home/webuser/www/
$ php5 /home/webuser/x_objects/xobjects.php webapp myapp</pre>
                    <p>This will build your webapp in /home/webuser/www/myapp</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Edit your app's index file and make sure the paths are correct; they should have been set by the installer:</p>
                    <p>Edit /home/webuser/www/myapp/index.php and check the values of $xobjects_location and $webapp_location.  For this
                example, the values would be:</p>
                <pre>
$xobjects_location = "/home/webuser/x_objects/x_objects/";
$webapp_location = "/home/webuser/www/myapp";
                </pre>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Make sure you have updated any virtual host information so you can invoke your web app directly</p>
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>
    </body>
